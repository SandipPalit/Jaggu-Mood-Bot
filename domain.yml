  utter_depression_symptoms:
  - text: Being unhappy isn’t the same as being depressed. Depression is
      a term often used loosely to describe how we feel after a bad week at work or
      when we’re going through a breakup. But major depressive disorder — a type of
      depression — is much more complicated. There are specific symptoms that determine
      whether it’s depression or the sadness we all sometimes experience in life.

  - text: Can you relate to these symptoms?
  utter_depression:
  - text: Depression is a common illness worldwide, with more than 264 million
      people affected. Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived
      emotional responses to challenges in everyday life. Especially when long-lasting
      and with moderate or severe intensity, depression may become a serious health
      condition. It can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly
      at work, at school and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide.
